# class_demo

## 1. Using any link from:
awesome-robotics-libraries or awesome-robotics or
even robotics-topic or any other - select a repository. The repo should
contains readme and at least 5 other elements (for example, 2 directories
and 3 files). Selected link put to googlesheet . All the repos should be
unique!

##  2. Reimplement the selected repo.
Imagine that you want to implement something cool and you clearly see
the result (The result is the selected repo, only master branch). You
are implementing it part by part. Since you are a good programmer, each
part is implemented in separate branch. The part means a commit or some
commits that contains addition at most ceil(dirs count at the root/4) dirs
or at most ceil(files count at the root/4) files. 80% of commits should
contain changes in the readme. For example, i have a repo with 5 files
and 4 folders in the root. I can add at most 2 files in each commit or at
most 1 folder. One more requirement: since our team is big and work on
this repo simultaneously - i want to see at least one moment in the history
with 4 branches.
As a result - all files in your repo should be the same as in the selected
repo.

##  3. Cleaning.
After finishing with the implementation you decided to clean the repo.
For that you remove readme file and add report.md file with content that
describes your work. Additional step - you found that first folder (any) is
useless and remove it.
##  4. Reporting.
Put the link to your github repo in the moodle.
